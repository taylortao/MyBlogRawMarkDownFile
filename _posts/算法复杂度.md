Typical algorithm complexity

| Complexity | Running time |
|:-:|:-:|
| Constant | O(1) |
| logarithmic | O(log(n)) |
| linear | O(n) |
| | O(n*log(n)) |
| quadratic | O(n^2) |
| cubic | O(n^3) |
| exponential | O(2^n), O(N!), O(n^k) |

a rough data: computer can perform about 50,000,000 elementary operations per second.

And the complexity will impacts the speed of execution of a given program.

> Constant, logarithmic, linear complexity, also n*log(n) is fast with a 100,000 size of the input data.
> Quadratic complexity works well about several thousands as size of the input data.
> Cubic complexity works well if elements less than 1000.
> exponential algorithm should be avoid to use. (unless the input data is a small amount)

so there is a chart like below:
