### Good questions to start

1. What is your role?
2. How long have you been in your current role? What did you do prior to this role?
3. Who is on your team (if applicable)? How do you envision me working with them?

4. What do you see as the most important issues/projects that your department needs to address over the next 12 months?
5. What do you see as the biggest challenges/issues I will face in my new role?
6. How do you think I can make the biggest impact in the short term? Long term?
7. How does my role impact you (and your team)?
8. Do you have responsibilities outside of you role? E.g. as a bar raiser, mentor, subject matter expert?
